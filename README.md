# Project Description

This is a professional, industry-level full-stack project encompassing both frontend and backend development. The primary objective of this application is to streamline the job application process for companies.

It features a candidate-facing application portal for job seekers to submit their applications, as well as a dedicated HR portal where recruiters can review, accept, or reject submissions. The functionality is simple yet effective, aiming to provide a practical solution to real-world hiring workflows.

Contributions are welcomeâ€”feel free to implement new features or improvements. I actively review and try to accept relevant pull requests.
